# GuitarHand-Tracking

**Disclaimer!**

This project's intended use is educational only. I have initially made this project as a project for my Computer Vision class. The old repository was taken down by my teacher with no explaination so I just reuploaded the code.
I have to mention that this project was not finished only by myself. This isn't the work of only one person, but since the initial repository has been taken down I can't prove the contribuiton of my classmate.

I have decided to make my project open-sourced because I do believe we are not meant to reinvent the wheel. So if somebody ever tries to make this project better at least they won't start from scratch.
